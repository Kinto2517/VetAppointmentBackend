## About The Project

The VetAppointment Backend is the server-side component of a comprehensive system designed to streamline and enhance the management of veterinary appointments. This backend serves as the core of the VetAppointment ecosystem, offering the necessary functionality to support various features within the application.

Developed with efficiency and user-friendliness in mind, the VetAppointment Backend handles the logic and data management for services such as appointment scheduling, client and pet information, vet doctor profiles, educational backgrounds, and professional experience. It ensures secure and reliable communication with the front-end and provides a robust foundation for building a seamless veterinary appointment management system.

This backend is implemented using modern web technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, and various other libraries to ensure reliability, security, and scalability. It adheres to best practices for API design, authentication, and authorization, making it a solid choice for building a powerful and user-friendly veterinary appointment management solution.
